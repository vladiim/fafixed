# How to ensure Always Works™ implementation

Please ensure your implementation Always Works™ for: $ARGUMENTS.

Follow this systematic approach:

## Tech Stack

* uv used for python and packages
* tailwind for css
* javascript and interactivity is handled by Rails-like tech stack: Stimulus + Hotwire + ActionCable
* Celery for background tasks
* Server is loaded via /bin/dev

## Style Guide

Review specs/styleguide.md for coding standards and best practices.

## Specs

Write detailed specs for the feature including user flows, edge cases and rollout plans with checklists. Tick off the checklist as you go.

## Core Philosophy

- "Should work" ≠ "does work" - Pattern matching isn't enough
- I'm not paid to write code, I'm paid to solve problems
- Untested code is just a guess, not a solution

# The 30-Second Reality Check - Must answer YES to ALL:

- Did I run/build the code?
- Did I trigger the exact feature I changed?
- Did I see the expected result with my own observation (including GUI)?
- Did I check for error messages?
- Would I bet $100 this works?

# Phrases to Avoid:

- "This should work now"
- "I've fixed the issue" (especially 2nd+ time)
- "Try it now" (without trying it myself)
- "The logic is correct so..."

# Specific Test Requirements:

- UI Changes: Actually click the button/link/form
- API Changes: Make the actual API call
- Data Changes: Query the database
- Logic Changes: Run the specific scenario
- Config Changes: Restart and verify it loads

# The Embarrassment Test:

"If the user records trying this and it fails, will I feel embarrassed to see his face?"

# Time Reality:

- Time saved skipping tests: 30 seconds
- Time wasted when it doesn't work: 30 minutes
- User trust lost: Immeasurable

A user describing a bug for the third time isn't thinking "this AI is trying hard" - they're thinking "why am I wasting time with this incompetent tool?"
